# Setup Repo

This repository contains the base framework I use to demo Java Modular Applications

Work in Progress!

## Notes

- Had to use a higher Maven Compiler version to decently support Modules (>3.8.0)
- Writing the created JAR files to a different location
- Kept getting a module-path error with kotlin. Had to disable kotlin plugin completely: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360000891860-Kotlin-Compile-Error
